# Cryptography
Raw implementation of some of the encryption techniques as taught in the MAS345
Codes and Cryptography maths module at the University of Sheffield. They are,
by no means, intended to be the most efficient implementations; rather, they are
written to roughly mimic the steps in each encryption techniques taught as an
alternative mean of revision, as well as to practise some programming.
